## ðŸŽ¯ Key Message

**"Pragmatism Often Outperforms Power in Offline RL"**

Your 96.67% success rate with a simple BC-IQL hybrid significantly outperforms complex diffusion models (35%), demonstrating that well-engineered combinations of stable methods can be more effective than cutting-edge generative approaches for practical robotic manipulation.
